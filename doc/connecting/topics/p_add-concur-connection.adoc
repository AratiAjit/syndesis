= Adding a SAP Concur connection to an integration

You can add a SAP Concur connection to the middle of a flow or
as the finish connection in a simple integration. 
A connection to SAP Concur can perform any one of 85 actions.  

.Prerequisites
* You created a SAP Concur connection.
* You are creating or editing a flow. 
* {prodname} is prompting you to add to the integration by choosing a step, or to choose the
finish connection in a simple integration.

.Procedure

. Click the SAP Concur
connection that you want to add to the flow. When the integration
uses the connection that you select, {prodname}
uses the credentials defined in that connection to connect to SAP Concur.

. Select the action that you want the connection to perform.  Each
SAP Concur connection that you add to a flow performs only the action 
you choose.
