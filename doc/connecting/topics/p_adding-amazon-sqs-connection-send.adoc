= Sending messages to an Amazon SQS queue

In the middle of a flow, or to finish a simple integration, 
you can send messages to an Amazon SQS queue. 

.Prerequisites
* You created an Amazon SQS connection that is configured to access 
the queue that you want to send messages to. 
* You know the name of the SQS queue that you want the connection to
send messages to. 
* {prodname} is prompting you to add a step, or to choose the finish 
connection for a simple integration. 

.Procedure

. Click the Amazon SQS connection that you want to use to send messages. 
. Click the action that you want the connection to perform:
+
* *Send Object* sends one message to the queue. 
* *Send Batch Object* sends a batch of messages to the queue. 

. In the *Message group ID strategy* field, for a first-in, first-out (FIFO)
queue, accept `ConstantMessageGroupIdStrategy` or click in the field and 
select one of the following:  
+
* `ExchangeIdMessageGroupIdStrategy`
* `PropertyValueMessageGroupIdStrategy`

. In the *Message deduplication ID strategy* field, for a FIFO queue, 
accept `NullMessageDeduplicationIdStrategy` or click in the field 
to select `ExchangeIdMessageDeduplicationIdStrategy`.

. In the *Queue Name or Amazon Resource Name* field, enter the 
name of the queue to send messages to. If the queue does not exist, 
the connection creates it. 

. In the *Delay* field, accept the default, which is 0 for no delay. 
Or, to add a delay, specify a number. The integration waits this number 
of seconds before sending messages.  
 
. Click *Next*. 

.Result
The connection appears in the integration flow where you added it.
