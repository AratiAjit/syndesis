= Triggering an integration when polling returns spreadsheet data

To trigger execution of an integration upon obtaining data from a
Google Sheets spreadsheet, add a Google Sheets connection to a simple integration 
as its start connection. When the integration is running, the Google Sheets 
connection polls the spreadsheet at the interval that you specified, obtains
the data that you identified, and passes the data to the next step in the 
integration.

To obtain data from a particular sheet in a spreadsheet, you specify the
sheet name when you configure the *Get sheet values* action for the
Google Sheets connection. A particular connection can obtain data from
only one sheet. 

Between polls, if there are no changes to the sheet values that the 
connection is configured to return, then 
the next poll returns the same values as the previous poll. 

.Prerequisites
* You created a Google Sheets connection that is authorized to access 
the spreadsheet that you want to obtain data from. 

.Procedure

. In the {prodname} panel on the left, click *Integrations*.
. Click *Create Integration*.
. On the *Choose a Start Connection* page, click the Google Sheets
connection that you want to use to start the integration.
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click the *Get sheet values* action.
. To configure the *Get sheet values* action:
.. In the *SpreadsheetId* field, enter the ID of a Google spreadsheet that is
accessible from the Google account that this Google Sheets connection
is authorized to access.
+
To obtain a spreadsheet ID, display the spreadsheet in a browser. 
The ID is the part of the URL between `d/` and `/edit`. 

.. In the *Range* field, enter Google A1 notation that identifies 
the data that you want to obtain. The default is *A:A*.
+
For example, suppose that you want all data from a spreadsheet that
has one sheet with 4 columns. Specify `A:D`. Or, to obtain data from
rows 5 through 15, specify `A5:D15`. 
+
If the spreadsheet from which you are 
obtaining data has more than one sheet, specify the sheet name as well 
as the start cell coordinate and the end cell coordinate. If there is more 
than one sheet, and you do not
specify a sheet name, then the connection obtains data from the first 
sheet in the spreadsheet. For example, specification of `2019!A1:D5` specifies
that you want to obtain data from the sheet whose name is `2019`. In that
sheet, you want the data that is in columns A through D for rows 1 through 5. 

.. In the *Major Dimension* field, accept *Rows*, which is the default, or
select *Columns*. *Rows* configures the action to return a collection
of row objects where each row object contains a value for each desired column. 
*Columns* configures the action to return a collection of column objects
where each column object contains a value for each desired row. 

.. In the *Split Results* field, accept *No*, which is the default, or
select *Yes*. A setting of *No* configures the action to
return data as a collection of values. That is,
the connection passes a collection of row objects or a collection of
column objects to the next step in the flow. 
Select *Yes* to enable the connection to split the returned data 
according to the setting of *Major Dimension*. For example, if 
*Major Dimension* is set to *Rows* then the connection returns row
objects. Each row object triggers a separate execution of the flow. 
That is, {prodname} executes the flow once for each returned row
object. For example, if the poll returns 5 rows then {prodname} executes
the flow 5 times.
+
{prodname} also provides discrete split and aggregate steps, which 
you can add to a flow. 
If you want to process individual objects in one or more steps and 
then aggregate the row or column objects, do not split the Google Sheets 
connection result. Instead, accept the default, *No*, and then add a 
split step to the flow after this connection. A split step is 
required if you want an aggregate step in the flow. 

.. In the *Delay* field, accept the default of 30 seconds or
specify how often you want the connection to obtain spreadsheet data.

.. In the *Max Results* field, accept the default of *25* or
specify another limit for the minor dimension in the result matrix. 
+
For example, suppose that the *Major Dimension* is columns and that 
*Max Results* is 25. The poll returns a column object for each column
that the range setting includes. Each column object contains no more than 
25 row values. 
+
In this release, it is a known problem that the setting for *Max Results* 
is observed only when *Split Results* is set to *Yes*. When *Split Results* 
is set to *No*, the setting of *Max Results* is ignored. In the next release, 
observance of the *Max Results* setting will not depend on the *Split Results* 
setting. 

. Click *Done* to add this Google Sheets connection as the integration's
start connection. In the integration visualization panel, the connection 
appears as the first step in the integration.

.Next steps
After you add a start connection, {prodname} prompts you to add the
integration's finish connection. With the start and finish connections
in the integration, add any other connections that you want in the
integration. Then, after the connection that obtains sheet values, 
add a data mapper step. In the data mapper, {prodname} displays 
source fields according to how you configure the *Get sheet values* action. 
That is, if the major dimension is *Rows*, then the data mapper lists 
the column names as fields that you can map to the target. If the major 
dimension is *COLUMNS*, then the data mapper lists row indexes as 
fields that you can map to the target.
