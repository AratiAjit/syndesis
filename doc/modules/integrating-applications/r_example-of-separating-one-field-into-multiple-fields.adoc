= Example of separating one field into multiple fields

Suppose that the source data contains one address field and it 
uses commas to separate the content parts, for example:

----
77 Hill Street, Brooklyn, New York, United States, 12345, 6789
----

In an address field, the parts of the content have these indexes: 

[options="header"]
[cols="2,1"]
|===
|Part
|Index

|Number and street
|1

|City
|2

|State
|3

|Country
|4

|Zip code
|5

|Zip+4
|6

|===

Now suppose that the target data has four fields for an address:

----
number-and-street
city
state
zip
----

To define the mapping, you need to do the following: 

. Select the source field. 
. In the *Mapping Details* panel, in the *Sources* section, 
select the delimiter, which is a comma in this example. 
. Select the four target fields. 

After you do this, in the *Mapping Details* panel under *Targets*, 
there is an entry for each target field that you selected, for example:

The data mapper displays the target entries in the order in which they 
appear in the data mapper, which is alphabetical. You need to change 
this order so that it mirrors the order in the source field. 
In this example, the source field contains the `number-and-street` content 
before the `city` content. To correct the order of the target entries, 
edit the `city` index field to be `2` or drag the `city` entry so 
that it is after the `number-and-street` entry. The result looks like 
this:

In the target field entries, the index numbers indicate the part of the 
source field that will be mapped to this target field. In this example, one of the 
index values needs to change to achieve the correct target field value. 
Consider each target field: 

* `number-and-street` — In the source field, the number and street content has an index of 1.  
It is correct to map the index 1 source to the `number-and-street` target field. 
No changes are needed in this target entry. 
* `city`  — In the source field, the city content has an index of 2. 
This target entry is also correct as it is. 
* `state`  — In the source field, the state content has an index of 3. 
This target entry is also correct as it is. 
* `zip`  — In the source field, the zip code content has an index of 5. 
The target field entry index of 4 is wrong. You would need to change it to 5. 
This instructs the data mapper to map the index 5 source content to the `zip` 
target field. After you change the index, the data mapper adds a 
padding field with an index of 4. The result looks like this:

This mapping is now complete. Although the source field has additional 
content at index 6, (zip+4), the target does not need the data and 
nothing needs to be done.
