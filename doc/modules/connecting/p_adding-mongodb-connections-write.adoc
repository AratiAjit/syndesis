= Operating on documents in a MongoDB database

In an integration, you can retrieve, count, update, remove, and add
documents to a MongoDB 
database. To do this, add a MongoDB connection to the middle of 
a flow or as a simple integration's finish connection. 

.Prerequisites
* You created a MongoDB connection. 
* You know the name of the MongoDB collection
that you want the connection to operate on.
* You are creating or editing an integration and {prodname} is
prompting you to add to the integration. Or, {prodname} is 
prompting you to choose a finish connection.  

.Procedure

. On the *Add to Integration* page, click the plus sign where you 
want to add a MongoDB connection. Skip this step if you are adding 
a simple integration's finish connection. 
. Click the MongoDB connection that you want to use.  
. On the *Choose an action* page, select the *MongoDB producer* action. 
. Configure the action: 
.. In the *Collection name* field, enter the name of the collection that 
you want the connection to operate on. 
.. In the *Operation to perform* field, accept the *Insert* operation or 
click in the field to display the available actions. Click the action 
that you want the connection to perform. 
See the table below for a description of each operation. 
. Click *Next*. 

.Result
The connection appears in the integration visualization where
you added it.

|*Find by id*
|Looks for a document that has the specified ID.
|A string that contains the ID of interest. 
|JSON notation that specifies the document that has the ID. 

|*Find all*

|None
|JSON notation that specifies all documents that are in the collection.

|*Insert*
|Adds a document to the collection. 
|JSON notation that specifies the document to add to the collection.
|JSON notation that specifies the inserted document.

|*Remove*
|Removes a document from the collection. 
|A JSON expression in the form of `{"test":"unit"}`. The operation removes each  document whose test attribute has a value of unit.
|JSON expression that specifies the number of documents that were removed, for example, `{"count":2}`.

|*Save*
|Adds a document to the collection or updates a document in the collection. 
|JSON notation that specifies the document to add or update.
|JSON notation that specifies the saved document.

|*Update*
|Updates a document in the collection. 
|An array of 2 arguments. The first argument is a filter expression that identifies the documents to update.
