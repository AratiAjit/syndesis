= Requirements and recommendations for OpenAPI documents used for API provider integrations 

After you specify an OpenAPI 2.0 document for your API provider 
integration, you can update the document as needed while you define
the execution flows for the API operations. To do this, click
*View/Edit API Definition* in the upper right of a page in
which you are editing the API provider integration. This displays
your OpenAPI document in the Apicurito editor. You can edit the 
document and save it. Any updates you make are reflected in
{prodname}.

To keep your OpenAPI document synchronized between the Apicurito 
editor and the {prodname} integration editor, your OpenAPI document 
must define a unique `operationId` property for each defined 
operation. If you do not assign an `operationId` property then
{prodname} generates one for each operation.

In each operation's definition, you can supply a JSON schema that
defines the operation's request and response. When you do then
{prodname} uses the JSON schema:

* As the basis for the operation's input and output data shapes
* To display operation fields in the data mapper

A JSON schema for an API provider integration operation cannot have cyclic 
schema references. 
For example, a JSON schema that specifies a request or response 
body cannot reference itself as a whole nor reference any part 
of itself through any number of intermediate JSON schemas.
