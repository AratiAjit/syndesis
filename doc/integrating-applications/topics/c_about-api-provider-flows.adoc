= About API provider integration flows

A {prodname} integration that does not start with a REST API service has one 
flow. That is, each time {prodname} executes the integration, {prodname} 
connects to the same applications, applies the same steps between connections, 
and finishes integration execution in the same way. 
This is a simple integration and it always has one execution path. 
 
An API provider integration has multiple flows. Each operation that the 
OpenAPI document defines has its own flow, which {prodname} automatically 
creates. For each operation, you can edit its flow by:
   
* Adding connections to the applications that need to process the data.
* Adding steps between connections, including split, aggregate, and data mapping steps.
* Altering the return code in the HTTP response that finishes the flow. The 
response goes to the application that invoked the call that triggered
execution of the integration.
