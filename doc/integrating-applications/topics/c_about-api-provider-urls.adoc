= About API provider integration URLs

After you publish an API provider integration, in the integration's
summary page, {prodname} displays the external URL for your REST API service.
This is where {prodname} publishes your REST API service. This 
external URL is the base URL for calls from REST clients to your REST API 
service URLs. 
Examples of REST clients are the `curl` utility, a web browser, the Postman app, 
and other applications that make REST calls. 

In an API provider integration, there is a flow for each operation that 
the OpenAPI document defines. Consequently, each operation can also have its own 
REST API service URL. Each URL is defined by the base URL 
and optionally by a subpath. REST API calls specify an operation's 
URL to trigger execution of the flow for that operation. 

Your OpenAPI document determines which HTTP verbs (such as 
`GET`, `POST`, `DELETE` and so on) you can specify
in calls to your REST API service URLs. Examples of calls to 
API provider URLs are in the 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#try-api-provider-quickstart_api-provider[instructions for trying out the API provider quickstart].   

The following diagram shows an API provider integration that processes data
about people. An external REST API client invokes the REST API URLs that are 
deployed by the API provider integration. Invocation of a URL triggers
execution of the  
flow for one REST operation. This API provider integration has 3 flows. 
Each flow can use any connection or step that 
is available in {prodname}. The REST API along with its flows 
is one {prodname} API provider integration, which is deployed in one OpenShift container/pod.
